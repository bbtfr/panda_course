        para: |
          Dr. Benedikt Gierlichs joined the COSIC research group at KU Leuven (Belgium) as a PhD student in 2006. He obtained a PhD in electrical engineering with his thesis on "Statistical and Information-Theoretic Methods for Power Analysis on Embedded Cryptography" in 2011. His research focuses on the (physical) security of embedded devices, in particular side-channel analysis, fault analysis and countermeasures. Prior to joining COSIC, Benedikt Gierlichs studied IT-security engineering at the university of Bochum and obtained an MSc in 2006. Further, he completed a long-term internship at the Security Technologies department of Gemplus (now part of Gemalto). Dr. Gierlichs is currently a post-doctoral fellow with the Funds for Scientific Research Flanders (Belgium). He is (co-)author of more than 25 scientific publications in international, peer-reviewed conferences and journals.

          Marc Witteman has a long track record in the security industry. He has been involved with a variety of security projects for over two decades and worked on applications in mobile communications, payment industry, identification, and pay television. Recent work includes secure programming and ePassport security issues. He has authored several articles on smart card and embedded device security issues. Further, he has extensive experience as a trainer, lecturing security topics for audiences ranging from novices to experts. As a security analyst he developed several tools for testing software and hardware security. This includes Inspector, a platform for conducting side-channel analysis and JCworkBench, a logical test tool. Marc Witteman has an MSc in Electrical Engineering from the Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands. From 1989 till 2001 he worked for several telecom operators, the ETSI standardization body and a security evaluation facility. In 2001 he founded Riscure, a security lab based in the Netherlands. Riscure offers consulting and testing services to manufacturers and issuers of advanced security technology. Between 2001 and 2011 he raised the company to a leading security test lab, and side channel test tool vendor. In 2010 Marc Witteman started Riscure Inc, the US branch of Riscure, based in San Francisco, California. At present he is the Chief Technology Officer of the Riscure Security Lab.

        para: |
          Yier Jin is currently an assistant professor in the EECS Department at the University of Central Florida. He received his PhD degree in Electrical Engineering in 2012 from Yale University after he got the B.S. and M.S. degrees in Electrical Engineering from Zhejiang University, China, in 2005 and 2007, respectively. His research focuses on the areas of trusted embedded systems, trusted hardware intellectual property (IP) cores and hardware-software co-protection on computer systems. He proposed various approaches in the area of hardware security, including the first hardware Trojan detection methodology relying on local side-channel information, the first post-deployment hardware trust assessment framework, and the first proof-carrying hardware IP protection scheme. He is also interested in the security analysis on Internet of Things (IoT) and wearable devices with particular emphasis on information integrity and privacy protection in the IoT era. He serves and has served on the Organizing Committees and Technical Program Committees of many Conferences and Workshops such as HOST, ISVLSI, ATS, ICCD, etc.

        subtitle: "Open Security Research, China"
        para: |
          Dr. Junfeng Fan graduated from KU Leuven (Belgium), his research focuses on the design of high-performance crypto chips, low-power elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) and resist physical attacks crypto chips. He has published six papers in international journals, two academic works(Chapters), twenties International academic conference papers, including 5 papers of CHES. He fist proposed the algorithm for polynomials-integer mixed modular multiplication, reduced the computational complexity of bilinear pairing (Pairing) based on BN curves. Using this algorithm, he designed the world's fastest Pairing coprocessor. He also designed for constrained devices the ECC ultra low-power chips, has systematic study of resist attacks of ECC, made a series of low-cost technology to check for errors. Designed in combination with Gierlichs and Vercauteren attack method based on the point at infinity. He founded the Open Security Research (Open Security Research, OSR) in Shenzhen in early 2014, dedicated to cryptographic chip attack and defense technology research.
